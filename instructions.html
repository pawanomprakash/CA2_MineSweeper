        <h1>Welcome to Minesweeper: Goblin Fields</h1>
        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>As an expert in detecting mines and bombs, your task is to help the farmer by uncovering all the tiles on the 8x8 grid while avoiding the hidden mines planted by the mischievous goblins.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Tile Types:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Numbered Tiles:</strong> These tiles indicate the number of mines surrounding them. If a tile displays "0," there are no mines around it, allowing you to unveil all adjacent tiles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mine Tiles:</strong> Steer clear of these! Uncovering a mine tile will end the game.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Unveiling Tiles:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Left-click on a tile to reveal its content.</li>
                    <li>Tiles marked with numbers indicate the count of mines in the adjacent tiles.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flagging Mines:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right-click on a tile to flag it as a potential mine.</li>
                    <li>Flagging helps you keep track of suspected mine locations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategy Tips:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the numbered tiles strategically. A "0" tile indicates a safe area to uncover adjacent tiles.</li>
                    <li>Analyze the numbered tiles to deduce potential mine locations.</li>
                    <li>Flag tiles suspected to be mines to avoid accidental clicks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Objective:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Successfully uncover all tiles except the hidden mines to win the game.</li>
                    <li>Carefully plan your moves to avoid triggering a mine tile.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Remember:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unlike traditional Minesweeper games, clicking on "0" tiles won't automatically unveil adjacent empty tiles.</li>
                    <li>Stay cautious and employ logical deduction to navigate the goblin-infested field.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Good luck, and may your expertise guide you through the Goblin Fields!</em></p>
